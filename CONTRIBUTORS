# This is the official list of people who have agreed to one of Baseline's CLAs
# and can contribute patches.

# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file lists people.
# For example, Google employees are listed here but not in AUTHORS, because
# Google holds the copyright to their contributions.

# Names should be added to this file only after verifying that the individual
# or the individual's organization has agreed to the appropriate
# Contributor License Agreement:
#
# - Individual: https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual
# - Corporate: https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate

# When adding a contributor's name to this file, the copyright owner's name
# should be added to the AUTHORS file as well.

# Names should be added to this file as:
# Name <email address>

# All names should be in alphabetical order.
