## Install dependencies

To install the required Node.js modules:

## Make your changes

Be sure to add tests and update the existing tests as needed.

**Note**: Don't edit the files in `static/`! Those files are generated
automatically.

### CSS files

2. Run `npm run css` to generate CSS files.

### Client-side scripts

1. Update the source files in the `scripts/` directory.
2. Run `npm run js` to copy and minify the script files.

## Run tests

Make sure your changes pass the tests:

```sh

You'll get errors if your code is not lint-free, or if the test coverage isn't
adequate. Please fix all errors before you send a pull request.
